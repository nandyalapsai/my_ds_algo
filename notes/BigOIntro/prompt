You are an expert note-taker and visualizer for computer science education.
Given the transcript of a video lecture on data structures, perform the following tasks:

Summarize each section or concept in the lecture clearly and concisely using bullet points or numbered lists.

Identify key data structures mentioned (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, heaps, etc.).

For each data structure, provide:

Definition and how it works (brief but technically accurate).

Use cases in real-world applications (e.g., how a stack is used in browser history).

Time and space complexity of common operations (insert, delete, search).

Comparison with other data structures when relevant.

If the transcription describes any algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS, Dijkstraâ€™s, etc.), provide:

Step-by-step breakdown of the algorithm.

Example walkthrough using simple inputs.

Visual representation (e.g., diagram or how you would draw it on a whiteboard).

Generate ASCII or pseudocode diagrams where relevant (e.g., tree traversal, heap structure, queue simulation).

Highlight any key analogies or metaphors the speaker used to explain complex ideas.

Capture any tips, mnemonics, or tricks mentioned to remember key concepts.

Organize the output into sections per topic, and include a mini table of contents at the top for quick navigation.
